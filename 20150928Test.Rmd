Time: `r Sys.time()`

## Brief introduction
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

***
## What you can do include:
* Embeding an R code chunk
* Embeding a plot
* Creating Equations

***
### To embed an R code chunk

#### 1. You can embed an R code chunk with both the code and the result like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

#### 2. You can embed only the R code like this:

```{r eval=F}
summary(cars)
```

> **The code you use** for embeding only the code is: `{r eval=F} summary(cars)`

#### 3. You can embed only the result of the R code chunk, like this:
```{r echo=F}
summary(cars)
```
> **The code you use** for embeding only the result is:`{r echo=F} summary(cars)`

#### 4. You can also change the comment characters:

```{r echo=F, comment="%%"}
summary(cars)
```

> **The code you use** to change the comment characters is:`{r echo=F, comment="%%" summary(cars)}`

***
### To embed a plot

#### 1. You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

#### 2. The configuration of the plot can be modified:

```{r, echo=F, fig.height=6, fig.width=6}
plot(cars)
```

***
### To create an equation
$A = \pi * r^{2}$

or

$\lambda = c/\nu$
